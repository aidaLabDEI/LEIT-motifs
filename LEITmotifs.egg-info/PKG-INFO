<div align = "center"> <strong>Scalable discovery of multidimensional motifs in time series</strong>

The algorithm employs Locality Sensitive Hashing `(LSH)` to prune the number of distance computations required to discover subdimensional motifs in multidimensional time series. </div>

## Implementation details
The code is implemented in Python 3.12, and it heavily relies on the 
*numba*, *multiprocessing* and *numpy* libraries to ensure scalability.

`requirements.txt` is provided to allow the creation of a working environment.

The algorithm has **anytime** properties, computation can be stopped at any given point and the algorithm will return the best results it achieved.

**Discretized Random Projections LSH** has been implemented with the use of *tensoring* to minimize the hash evaluations.

For general use the `LEITmotifs` function does all the heavy lifting (i.e., deals with NaN values, transforms the time series in the correct format for the algorithm, etc.).


## Reproducibility
The scripts in the folder `tests` replicate all the tests performed in the paper and some additional tests that we could
not fit in the paper due to space limitations, the scripts produce *.csv* files in the `results` folder.

The file `results/plotter.py` collects all the raw results and plots them.


## Installation as a Python package

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/aidaLabDEI/LEIT-motifs
```
```python
from LEITmotifs import LEITmotifs
# Example usage:
# let Ts be a D-dimensional time series as a numpy array,
# window the length of the motifs to discover,
# and k the number of motifs to discover
motifs, _ = LEITmotifs(Ts, window, k, (2,D))
```
